A series of 9 lab experiments meant to introduce the students
to practical aspects of autonomous systems. Each experiment takes 3 hours in the
lab. In these experiments the students will study various tools and theoretical
aspects of an autonomous system. Implementing algorithms in python and C++
using the platforms embedded pc and microcontroller. Through the experiments the
students will learn how to implement simple and advanced autonomy in addition to
the various system requirements in the process.
